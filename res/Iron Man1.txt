00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,587
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

3
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,714
This is crazy. What did I do?

4
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,257
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

5
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:32,760
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

6
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,053
We can talk, sir.

7
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,932
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

8
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:41,185
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

9
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,729
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

10
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:46,607
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

11
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,442
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

12
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:51,278
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

13
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:54,198
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

14
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:57,076
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

15
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,830
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

16
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,082
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

17
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,625
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

18
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,628
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

19
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,589
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

20
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:14,552
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,473
All right.

22
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,642
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

23
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,310
Please, no gang signs.

24
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:24,979
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

25
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:28,065
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

26
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:32,236
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

27
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,869
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

28
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,662
What have we got?

29
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,999
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

30
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,125
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

31
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,008
Son of a bitch!

32
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,470
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

33
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,084
Whoa!

34
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,843
Tony Stark.

35
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,764
Visionary. Genius.

36
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,475
American patriot.

37
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,726
Even from an early age,

38
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:30,271
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

39
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:33,899
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

40
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:37,444
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

41
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,697
At age six, his first engine.

42
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:44,201
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

43
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,538
Then, the passing of a titan.

44
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,042
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

45
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:55,546
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

46
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,091
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

47
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,553
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

48
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:03,971
With the keys to the kingdom,

49
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,849
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

50
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,978
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

51
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,940
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

52
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:17,818
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

53
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,487
and her interests around the globe.

54
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,165
As liaison to Stark Industries,

55
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,502
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

56
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,340
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

57
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,009
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

58
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:46,430
to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

59
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:54,938
Tony?

60
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,828
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

61
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:13,582
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

62
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,125
This is wonderful.

63
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,004
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

64
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:26,011
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

65
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:31,100
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

66
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:32,935
Tony, you know...

67
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:36,939
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

68
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,440
He's always working.

69
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:43,946
Work it! Come on!

70
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:51,036
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

71
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,415
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

72
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:55,457
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

73
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,419
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

74
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,421
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

75
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,214
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

76
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,425
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

77
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:05,884
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

78
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:08,262
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

79
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,930
I don't have any of those
floating around.

80
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,141
We're gonna let it ride!

81
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,352
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

82
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:16,562
Okay, you, too.

83
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,522
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

84
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,108
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

85
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,443
Two craps. Line away.

86
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,361
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

87
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:25,863
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

88
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:27,448
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

89
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:28,490
Tomorrow, don't be late.

90
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:29,825
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

91
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,201
I know, I know.

92
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:34,830
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

93
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,503
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

94
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:44,089
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

95
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:45,257
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

96
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,842
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

97
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:47,968
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,970
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

99
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,889
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

100
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:54,808
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

101
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:56,477
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

102
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,769
"The Merchant of Death"?

103
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,396
That's not bad.

104
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:03,275
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

105
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,903
Well, Ms. Brown,

106
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:08,447
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

107
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,241
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

108
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:13,494
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

109
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:14,661
Rehearse that much?

110
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,413
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

111
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,832
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

112
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,168
All I want is a serious answer.

113
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,504
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

114
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:26,006
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

115
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,342
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

116
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,220
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

117
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,889
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

118
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,182
would call that being a hero.

119
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,434
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

120
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,686
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

121
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,522
by advancing medical technology

122
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,941
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

123
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:47,277
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

124
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,781
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

125
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,783
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

126
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,632
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

127
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:12,386
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

128
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,889
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

129
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:18,433
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

130
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,743
Tony?

131
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,496
Hey, Tony?

132
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,562
You are not authorized
to access this area.

133
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:06,398
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

134
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,526
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

135
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:11,361
and there's a car waiting for you outside

136
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:13,739
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

137
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:17,576
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

138
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:23,081
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

139
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,501
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

140
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:29,379
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

141
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:30,547
Will that be all?

142
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,107
Give me an exploded view.

143
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:52,444
The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

144
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,071
Log that.

145
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,910
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

146
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:00,994
I'll keep you posted.

147
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,829
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

148
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:05,290
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

149
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,917
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

150
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,710
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

151
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,921
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

152
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,547
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

153
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,383
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

154
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:15,550
before I get you out of the door.

155
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:17,886
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

156
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,179
if it departs before you arrive?

157
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,641
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

158
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,351
Do you want it? Yes or no.

159
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,520
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

160
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,815
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

161
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,149
where he lived and worked,

162
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:32,734
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

163
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:37,197
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

164
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:40,659
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

165
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:43,995
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

166
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,873
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

167
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,376
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

168
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,961
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

169
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,379
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

170
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,381
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

171
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,008
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

172
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,136
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

173
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,721
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

174
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,264
I knew that. Already?

175
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,934
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

176
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,396
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

177
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,940
- And?
- It was very nice.

178
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,485
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

179
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:18,280
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

180
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:22,451
Okay.

181
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,431
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

182
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:49,019
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

183
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,645
I got you. I got you.

184
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,147
What's wrong with you?

185
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,774
- What?
- Three hours.

186
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,984
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

187
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,069
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

188
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:00,697
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

189
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:03,325
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

190
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,960
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

191
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:16,254
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

192
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,049
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

193
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,592
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

194
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:21,802
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

195
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:22,928
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

196
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,387
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

197
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,680
You don't respect yourself,

198
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,140
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

199
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,558
I'm just your babysitter.

200
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,144
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

201
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:33,438
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

202
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,148
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

203
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:36,650
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

204
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,485
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

205
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,987
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

206
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:42,656
incapable of being responsible.

207
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,283
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

208
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:46,409
Hot sake?

209
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:49,830
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

210
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,248
That's what I'm talking about.

211
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,376
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

212
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,253
you know what I recognize?

213
00:13:56,337 --> 00:14:01,550
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

214
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:04,344
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

215
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,514
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

216
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,432
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

217
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,602
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

218
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:30,245
General.

219
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,915
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

220
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Thanks.

221
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,796
Is it better to be feared or respected?

222
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:43,049
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

223
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,887
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

224
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,763
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

225
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:49,890
It's the first missile system

226
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,851
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

227
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,897
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

228
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:58,940
I respectfully disagree.

229
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:03,069
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

230
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:06,531
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

231
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,451
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

232
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:10,869
Find an excuse

233
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,247
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

234
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:17,876
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

235
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:40,148
For your consideration, the Jericho.

236
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:52,744
I'll be throwing one of these in

237
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,829
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

238
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:55,956
To peace!

239
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,751
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

240
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,295
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

241
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,214
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

242
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:08,176
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

243
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,719
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

244
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,388
Good night, Tony.

245
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,266
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

246
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,310
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

247
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:20,105
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

248
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,257
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

249
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,629
What the hell did you do to me?

250
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:10,006
What I did?

251
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,051
What I did is to save your life.

252
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:16,930
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

253
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,848
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

254
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,351
Here, want to see?

255
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,854
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

256
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,734
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

257
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,237
We call them the walking dead

258
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,490
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

259
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,368
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

260
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,287
hooked up to a car battery,

261
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:44,290
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

262
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,634
That's right. Smile.

263
00:18:56,345 --> 00:19:00,473
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

264
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,560
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

265
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,980
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

266
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,233
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

267
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,651
Where are we?

268
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:15,488
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

269
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,491
Just do as I do.

270
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,244
Come on, put your hands up.

271
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,455
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

272
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,916
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

273
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:51,608
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

274
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,526
"in the history of America."

275
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,489
He is honored.

276
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,785
He wants you to build the missile.

277
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,497
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

278
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,252
This one.

279
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
I refuse.

280
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,103
Tony!

281
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,447
He wants to know what you think.

282
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:24,200
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

283
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:37,297
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

284
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,049
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

285
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:45,888
He says for you
to start working immediately,

286
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:49,225
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

287
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,273
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

288
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,456
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

289
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,625
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

290
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:20,006
Look, what you just saw,

291
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,925
that is your legacy, Stark.

292
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,889
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

293
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,266
Is that how you want to go out?

294
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,772
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

295
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,066
Or are you going to
do something about it?

296
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,279
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

297
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:46,616
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

298
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,076
Well, then,

299
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,788
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

300
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,086
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

301
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,381
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

302
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,633
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

303
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,761
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

304
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,568
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

305
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,363
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

306
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,490
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

307
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,993
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

308
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:36,457
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

309
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,168
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

310
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:50,012
You know, we might be more productive

311
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,890
if you include me
in the planning process.

312
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,693
Okay, we don't need this.

313
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,113
What is that?

314
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,950
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

315
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:15,037
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

316
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,625
What's he doing?

317
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,544
Working.

318
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:34,557
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

319
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,351
Relax. I have steady hands.

320
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,855
Why do you think you're still alive?

321
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,490
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

322
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,409
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

323
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,120
Nice to meet you, too.

324
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,454
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

325
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:41,999
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

326
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,127
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

327
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,214
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

328
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,966
But what could it generate?

329
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,637
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

330
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:57,557
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

331
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,726
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

332
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:13,072
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

333
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,158
Flatten them out and look.

334
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:19,704
Oh, wow.

335
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,375
Impressive.

336
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,361
Good.

337
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,114
Good roll. Good roll.

338
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,783
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

339
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:00,703
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

340
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:04,206
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

341
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:08,919
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

342
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,339
And you, Stark?

343
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,637
- No.
- No?

344
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,016
So you're a man who has everything

345
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,060
and nothing.

346
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,775
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

347
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,443
Maybe it's been modified.

348
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,569
The tail is wrong.

349
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:16,654
It's just backwards.

350
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,659
Relax.

351
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:14,962
The bow and arrow

352
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,923
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

353
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,887
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

354
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,682
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

355
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:31,020
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

356
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,691
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

357
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,654
But today,

358
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,867
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

359
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,787
rules these lands.

360
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,499
And soon,

361
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,212
it will be my turn.

362
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,893
Why have you failed me?

363
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,395
We're working.

364
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,064
Diligently.

365
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,066
I let you live.

366
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,278
This is how you repay me?

367
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,281
It's very complex.

368
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,034
He's trying very hard.

369
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,410
On his knees.

370
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,750
You think I'm a fool?

371
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:36,794
I'll get the truth.

372
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:38,879
We're both working.

373
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,471
Open your mouth.

374
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,848
What does he want?

375
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,225
You think I'm a fool?

376
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,605
What's going on?

377
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,608
Tell me the truth.

378
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,277
He's building your Jericho.

379
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:06,782
What do you want? A delivery date?

380
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,416
I need him.

381
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,086
Good assistant.

382
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:27,887
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

383
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:35,037
Okay? Can you move?

384
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,373
Okay, say it again.

385
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,959
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

386
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:43,545
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

387
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,471
Where is Stark?

388
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,723
He was here a moment ago.

389
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:55,933
Go look for him.

390
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:14,243
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

391
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,370
Say something.
Say something back to him.

392
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,831
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

393
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:21,417
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

394
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,817
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

395
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,861
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

396
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,572
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

397
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:52,948
Okay.

398
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,200
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

399
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,912
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

400
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,539
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

401
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:01,749
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

402
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,375
- I have it.
- Press Control "l".

403
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,878
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."

404
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,713
Come over here and button me up.

405
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,925
Okay. All right.

406
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,343
Every other hex bolt.

407
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,554
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

408
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,014
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

409
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,727
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

410
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,562
We need more time.

411
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:25,773
Hey,

412
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:29,860
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

413
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,987
Stick to the plan!

414
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,157
Yinsen!

415
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,290
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

416
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:46,515
Stark.

417
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,935
Come on. We got to go.

418
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:53,563
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

419
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,565
This was always the plan, Stark.

420
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,193
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

421
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,613
My family is dead.

422
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,700
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

423
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,578
It's okay.

424
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:13,667
I want this. I want this.

425
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,591
Thank you for saving me.

426
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:27,055
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

427
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:07,095
My turn.

428
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Not bad.

429
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,025
Hey!

430
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,508
How was the "fun-vee"?

431
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,221
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

432
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,045
Watch it, coming up here.

433
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:32,133
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

434
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:43,770
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

435
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:48,483
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

436
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:51,319
Where to, sir?

437
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:53,029
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

438
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:54,197
No? Tony, you have to

439
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:55,282
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

440
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:57,117
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

441
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,868
I've been in captivity for three months.

442
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:02,706
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

443
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,748
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

444
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,251
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

445
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,586
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

446
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,213
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

447
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:24,436
Look at this!

448
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:27,522
Tony.

449
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:32,694
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

450
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:34,195
Look at you!

451
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:37,324
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

452
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:39,868
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

453
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,665
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

454
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:52,505
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

455
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,840
Can I speak to you for a moment?

456
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:57,552
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

457
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:58,970
I'm not a reporter.

458
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:00,472
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

459
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,307
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

460
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,975
and Logistics Division.

461
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,811
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

462
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:11,316
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

463
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,070
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

464
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:18,823
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

465
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:22,202
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

466
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,584
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

467
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:33,088
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

468
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:35,382
A little less formal and...

469
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,931
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

470
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:45,058
I don't know what he's up to.

471
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:47,560
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

472
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:50,105
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

473
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:53,066
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

474
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,154
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

475
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,282
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

476
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:05,662
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

477
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,875
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

478
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:17,340
I saw young Americans killed

479
00:45:18,217 --> 00:45:22,262
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

480
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:25,056
And I saw

481
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:31,062
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

482
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:33,148
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

483
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:35,859
What happened over there?

484
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:40,405
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

485
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:44,868
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

486
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:48,413
And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

487
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:52,167
the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

488
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:56,254
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

489
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:57,922
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

490
00:45:58,007 --> 00:45:59,758
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

491
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:03,887
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

492
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:10,018
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

493
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:12,812
And he's healthier than ever.

494
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:16,274
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

495
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,777
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

496
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:23,239
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

497
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:36,961
Well, that... That went well.

498
00:46:37,046 --> 00:46:39,464
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

499
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:41,883
Your head? What about my head?

500
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:45,011
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

501
00:46:45,137 --> 00:46:48,181
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

502
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:49,557
Yep.

503
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:53,144
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

504
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:55,897
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

505
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:58,608
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

506
00:46:58,692 --> 00:46:59,818
It's my name on the side of the building.

507
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:02,529
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

508
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:04,572
Not based on what I saw.

509
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:06,825
We're not doing a good enough job.

510
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,159
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

511
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:11,120
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

512
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:15,375
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

513
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:19,796
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

514
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,258
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

515
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:26,469
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

516
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:30,223
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

517
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:33,476
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

518
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:34,727
Maybe.

519
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:37,730
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

520
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:40,358
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

521
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:45,196
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

522
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:48,533
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

523
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,952
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

524
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,837
- Okay.
- Okay?

525
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,383
It works.

526
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:13,600
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

527
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:16,936
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

528
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:18,438
like your father and I.

529
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:20,315
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

530
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:21,983
- But if I had...
- Tony.

531
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:25,069
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

532
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:27,906
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

533
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,658
You gotta let me handle this.

534
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:33,161
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

535
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,079
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

536
00:48:35,164 --> 00:48:38,416
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

537
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,418
Stark Industries!

538
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:43,379
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

539
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:44,631
Sell, sell, sell!

540
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,799
Abandon ship!

541
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:50,261
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

542
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:56,559
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

543
00:48:58,187 --> 00:49:02,148
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

544
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:05,526
Pepper. How big are your hands?

545
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:08,237
- What?
- How big are your hands?

546
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:11,199
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

547
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:19,666
Hey.

548
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,212
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

549
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:25,296
Let's see them.

550
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:27,715
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

551
00:49:28,676 --> 00:49:31,219
I just need your help for a sec.

552
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:34,180
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

553
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:36,849
It was. It is now an antique.

554
00:49:37,643 --> 00:49:40,436
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

555
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:45,149
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

556
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:48,152
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

557
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:51,614
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

558
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:54,826
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

559
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,577
It's fine.

560
00:49:57,454 --> 00:49:59,372
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

561
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:01,249
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

562
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:05,628
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

563
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:08,506
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

564
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,216
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

565
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,676
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

566
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,220
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

567
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:18,349
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

568
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,687
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

569
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:26,816
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

570
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,445
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

571
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:33,656
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

572
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,409
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

573
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:37,618
Okay.

574
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:43,541
Oh, there's pus!

575
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:48,254
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

576
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,256
- not from my body.
- It smells!

577
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,883
Yeah, it does.

578
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,927
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

579
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:56,137
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

580
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:59,140
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

581
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:00,224
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

582
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:01,642
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

583
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:03,895
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

584
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:06,898
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

585
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:08,149
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

586
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,401
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

587
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:11,486
What's wrong?

588
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,945
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

589
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,322
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

590
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:17,158
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

591
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:19,243
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

592
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,370
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

593
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:22,413
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

594
00:51:22,498 --> 00:51:25,166
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

595
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:29,837
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

596
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:37,428
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

597
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:39,639
Nice.

598
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:41,974
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

599
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,351
You okay?

600
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,647
Don't ever, ever, ever,

601
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:50,733
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

602
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:52,944
I don't have anyone but you.

603
00:51:58,575 --> 00:51:59,575
Anyway...

604
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:08,376
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

605
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:10,545
Destroy it.

606
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,588
Incinerate it.

607
00:52:13,257 --> 00:52:14,882
You don't want to keep it?

608
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:19,137
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

609
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,391
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

610
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,810
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

611
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,812
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

612
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:31,107
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

613
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:34,110
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

614
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:44,579
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

615
00:52:44,872 --> 00:52:46,998
I'll tell you, in my experience,

616
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:51,836
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

617
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:53,462
his insight,

618
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:56,549
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

619
00:52:56,633 --> 00:53:00,261
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

620
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:03,347
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

621
00:53:03,432 --> 00:53:05,433
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

622
00:53:05,517 --> 00:53:07,435
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

623
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,353
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

624
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:12,064
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

625
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:13,441
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

626
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:14,901
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

627
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:16,068
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

628
00:53:16,153 --> 00:53:17,403
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

629
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:18,654
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

630
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:21,699
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

631
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,287
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

632
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:29,123
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

633
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:31,042
I'm doing a little better than walking.

634
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:32,627
- Really?
- Yeah.

635
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:35,963
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

636
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:39,050
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

637
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:42,762
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

638
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:45,848
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

639
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:47,516
that was a doozy.

640
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:52,396
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

641
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:55,149
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

642
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:56,651
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

643
00:53:56,735 --> 00:54:00,655
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

644
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:04,075
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

645
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:09,205
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

646
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,498
Thanks.

647
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:22,134
- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

648
00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:26,305
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark II.

649
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:31,185
Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

650
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,854
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

651
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:36,774
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

652
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:39,568
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

653
00:54:43,532 --> 00:54:46,617
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

654
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:51,247
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

655
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:37,251
Next. Up.

656
00:55:37,878 --> 00:55:40,755
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

657
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:42,923
Stay put. Nice.

658
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,596
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

659
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:51,223
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

660
00:55:58,106 --> 00:55:59,273
Up.

661
00:56:00,108 --> 00:56:01,942
Screw it. Don't even move.

662
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:05,112
You are a tragedy.

663
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,541
Okay, let's do this right.

664
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,045
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

665
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:26,008
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

666
00:56:26,093 --> 00:56:27,510
You, roll it.

667
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:33,391
Okay. Activate hand controls.

668
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:38,896
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

669
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,149
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

670
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:43,609
And three,

671
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:45,486
two,

672
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:47,405
one.

673
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,777
Up two. All right, set that.

674
00:57:26,862 --> 00:57:29,280
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

675
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:31,198
Yeah, everything's... What?

676
00:57:31,283 --> 00:57:32,450
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

677
00:57:32,534 --> 00:57:34,535
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

678
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:36,245
Okay.

679
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,831
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

680
00:57:38,915 --> 00:57:39,915
It is.

681
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:44,003
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

682
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:49,258
I didn't expect that.

683
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:55,973
How'd it go?

684
00:57:58,226 --> 00:57:59,894
It went that bad, huh?

685
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:02,646
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

686
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:06,609
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

687
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:09,570
It would have gone better
if you were there.

688
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,363
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

689
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:15,993
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

690
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:21,248
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

691
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,752
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

692
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:25,961
They're filing an injunction.

693
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:28,088
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

694
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:29,381
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

695
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:30,466
We knew that was gonna happen.

696
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,635
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

697
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:34,929
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

698
00:58:35,013 --> 00:58:37,765
Tony, the board has rights, too.

699
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:42,520
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

700
00:58:42,604 --> 00:58:44,855
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

701
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,942
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

702
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,738
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

703
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:53,864
This is great.

704
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:57,409
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

705
00:58:57,494 --> 00:58:59,703
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

706
00:58:59,788 --> 00:59:03,123
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

707
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,792
Something to pitch them.

708
00:59:04,918 --> 00:59:08,379
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

709
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:10,589
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

710
00:59:10,674 --> 00:59:12,258
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

711
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:15,177
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

712
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:17,096
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

713
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,681
- Take two.
- Thank you.

714
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,641
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

715
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,351
Good night, Obie.

716
00:59:22,978 --> 00:59:27,815
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

717
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:30,568
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

718
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:33,487
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

719
00:59:33,572 --> 00:59:35,406
All right, nice and easy.

720
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:40,452
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

721
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:44,039
And three, two, one.

722
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:56,885
Okay.

723
00:59:58,179 --> 00:59:59,805
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

724
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:02,308
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

725
01:00:02,392 --> 01:00:04,101
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

726
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:06,437
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

727
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,147
Three, two, one.

728
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:27,291
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

729
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,709
Not the car, not the car!

730
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:31,045
Table!

731
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:46,268
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

732
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:05,913
No!

733
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:09,625
Yeah, I can fly.

734
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:17,341
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

735
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:19,677
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

736
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:21,804
Import all preferences
from home interface.

737
01:01:21,888 --> 01:01:23,347
Will do, sir.

738
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,313
All right, what do you say?

739
01:01:31,398 --> 01:01:34,900
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

740
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:36,610
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

741
01:01:36,695 --> 01:01:39,697
Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

742
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:41,073
Do a check on control surfaces.

743
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:42,700
As you wish.

744
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:07,141
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

745
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:10,144
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

746
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:11,729
Start listening in on ground control.

747
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:12,896
Sir, there are still terabytes

748
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:15,566
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

749
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:19,570
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

750
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:23,991
Ready? In three, two, one.

751
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:49,057
Handles like a dream.

752
01:03:17,128 --> 01:03:18,754
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

753
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,255
What's SR-71 's record?

754
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:24,134
The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.

755
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:27,221
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

756
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:34,019
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

757
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:35,229
Keep going!

758
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:38,816
Higher!

759
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:56,750
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

760
01:03:59,504 --> 01:04:01,880
Come on, we got to break the ice!

761
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,375
Kill power.

762
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:05,963
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

763
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:10,467
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

764
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:12,803
A very astute observation, sir.

765
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,638
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

766
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,181
we should improve the exosystems.

767
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:18,850
Connect to the sys. Co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

768
01:06:18,935 --> 01:06:22,020
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

769
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:25,983
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

770
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:27,317
- Got it?
- Yes.

771
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:29,736
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

772
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:31,196
Thrill me.

773
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:37,119
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

774
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:41,456
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

775
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:43,125
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

776
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:44,459
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

777
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:47,045
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

778
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,588
...hasn't been seen in public

779
01:06:48,673 --> 01:06:52,426
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

780
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:55,262
Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

781
01:06:55,346 --> 01:06:58,974
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

782
01:06:59,434 --> 01:07:02,185
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

783
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,438
The render is complete.

784
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:06,189
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

785
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:09,359
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

786
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:13,613
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

787
01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:16,616
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

788
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:21,663
The render is complete.

789
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:24,041
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

790
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,709
Commencing automated assembly.

791
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:28,962
Estimated completion time is five hours.

792
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:30,172
Don't wait up for me, honey.

793
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:58,116
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

794
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:01,995
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

795
01:08:04,624 --> 01:08:07,167
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

796
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:10,170
You look great, Hef.

797
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,298
We're going to have a great quarter.

798
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:17,135
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

799
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:21,431
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

800
01:08:21,516 --> 01:08:23,266
I'll see you inside.

801
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:27,104
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

802
01:08:27,188 --> 01:08:28,939
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

803
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:32,609
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

804
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:40,700
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

805
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:43,161
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

806
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:45,831
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

807
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:49,251
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

808
01:08:49,335 --> 01:08:50,961
God, you need a new name for that.

809
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:53,046
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

810
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,634
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

811
01:08:57,718 --> 01:08:59,678
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

812
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,638
and time can be a factor
with these things.

813
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:03,765
Let's just put something on the books.

814
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:07,227
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
At Stark Industries?

815
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:10,856
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

816
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:15,277
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

817
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,822
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

818
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:21,158
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

819
01:09:21,242 --> 01:09:23,034
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

820
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:24,953
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

821
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:27,164
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

822
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:28,498
Yes.

823
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,500
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

824
01:09:30,585 --> 01:09:33,086
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

825
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:45,765
Am I making you uncomfortable?

826
01:09:46,142 --> 01:09:51,396
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

827
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,317
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

828
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:58,153
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

829
01:09:58,237 --> 01:10:00,113
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

830
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:03,867
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

831
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,368
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

832
01:10:05,453 --> 01:10:07,954
What's your Social Security number?

833
01:10:11,459 --> 01:10:13,210
- Five.
- Five?

834
01:10:14,045 --> 01:10:15,337
- Right.
- Right.

835
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:17,756
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

836
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,051
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

837
01:10:33,648 --> 01:10:36,691
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

838
01:10:38,653 --> 01:10:40,570
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

839
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:43,490
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

840
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:44,950
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

841
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:46,826
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

842
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:50,080
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

843
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:53,541
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

844
01:10:53,626 --> 01:10:56,419
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

845
01:10:56,504 --> 01:10:59,756
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

846
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,217
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

847
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,261
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

848
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:07,222
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

849
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:09,224
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

850
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:13,103
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

851
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:15,939
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

852
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,789
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

853
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,085
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

854
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:41,881
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

855
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:45,802
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

856
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:48,054
Make one of them dirty, will you?

857
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:55,270
Wow. Tony Stark.

858
01:11:55,604 --> 01:11:57,939
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

859
01:12:01,986 --> 01:12:02,986
- Carrie.
- Christine.

860
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:04,070
That's right.

861
01:12:04,155 --> 01:12:06,823
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

862
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:08,325
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

863
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:10,827
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

864
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,287
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

865
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:13,705
involvement in this latest atrocity.

866
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:16,333
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

867
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:18,793
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

868
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:21,254
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

869
01:12:21,339 --> 01:12:23,673
Is this what you call accountability?

870
01:12:23,758 --> 01:12:26,468
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

871
01:12:38,022 --> 01:12:40,440
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

872
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:42,942
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

873
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,986
Well, I'm not my company.

874
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:49,366
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

875
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,784
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

876
01:12:50,868 --> 01:12:54,204
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

877
01:12:54,288 --> 01:12:56,122
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

878
01:12:56,207 --> 01:12:57,582
"This is how we do business."

879
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:00,877
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

880
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:03,463
Tony, your picture, please!

881
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:09,177
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

882
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:14,099
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

883
01:13:14,809 --> 01:13:18,103
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

884
01:13:20,523 --> 01:13:23,274
It was the only way I could protect you.

885
01:13:25,653 --> 01:13:26,861
No. No.

886
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:39,207
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

887
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:43,002
as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

888
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,089
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

889
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:47,882
have been driven from their homes,

890
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:52,220
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

891
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:55,557
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

892
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,435
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

893
01:13:58,519 --> 01:14:02,355
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

894
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:10,530
Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

895
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:13,366
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

896
01:14:13,576 --> 01:14:16,953
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

897
01:14:17,037 --> 01:14:21,166
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

898
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:23,918
With no political will
or international pressure,

899
01:14:24,003 --> 01:14:26,463
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

900
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:29,799
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

901
01:14:29,884 --> 01:14:31,676
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

902
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,345
either forced to join their militia...

903
01:14:35,347 --> 01:14:37,974
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

904
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:40,643
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

905
01:14:40,728 --> 01:14:44,355
A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

906
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:48,359
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

907
01:14:48,444 --> 01:14:52,322
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

908
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:26,457
Hurry it up.

909
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:27,750
Put the women in the trucks.

910
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:28,876
Stack the weapons here.

911
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:29,961
Clear all the houses.

912
01:16:30,045 --> 01:16:31,713
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

913
01:16:39,888 --> 01:16:40,888
Grab that dog.

914
01:16:43,851 --> 01:16:45,977
Put him with the others.

915
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:58,197
What the hell is this?

916
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:11,711
Shoot this dog.

917
01:17:11,879 --> 01:17:13,463
You're all incompetent.

918
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:17,800
Turn your head.

919
01:18:24,576 --> 01:18:26,285
He's all yours.

920
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:27,096
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

921
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:29,265
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

922
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:31,058
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

923
01:19:31,143 --> 01:19:32,810
Get those monitors up!

924
01:19:32,895 --> 01:19:34,228
We got a bogey!

925
01:19:34,313 --> 01:19:36,439
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

926
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:38,483
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

927
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,234
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

928
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:41,986
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

929
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,572
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

930
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:46,908
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

931
01:19:47,034 --> 01:19:49,660
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

932
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,211
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

933
01:19:58,295 --> 01:20:00,004
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

934
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:02,298
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

935
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:04,091
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

936
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:05,843
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

937
01:20:05,928 --> 01:20:07,303
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

938
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:09,347
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

939
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:11,599
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

940
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:14,060
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

941
01:20:14,144 --> 01:20:15,978
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

942
01:20:18,524 --> 01:20:21,484
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

943
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,823
- Hello?
- Tony?

944
01:20:26,907 --> 01:20:28,658
- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

945
01:20:28,909 --> 01:20:30,993
- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

946
01:20:31,078 --> 01:20:33,955
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

947
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:37,500
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

948
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:38,960
It's funny how that works, huh?

949
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:42,421
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

950
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:44,173
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

951
01:20:44,258 --> 01:20:45,883
Well, that's a hot spot.

952
01:20:45,968 --> 01:20:48,469
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

953
01:20:48,554 --> 01:20:49,637
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

954
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:50,930
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

955
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:52,807
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

956
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:54,684
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

957
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:57,103
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

958
01:20:57,187 --> 01:20:58,688
- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

959
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:01,524
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

960
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:04,986
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

961
01:21:05,696 --> 01:21:07,446
That's my exit.

962
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,621
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

963
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:17,248
Whiplash One, what is it?

964
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:18,666
I've got no idea.

965
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:21,085
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

966
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,253
Then you are clear to engage.

967
01:21:24,298 --> 01:21:25,298
Hit it.

968
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:33,139
That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

969
01:21:37,144 --> 01:21:39,145
- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

970
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:44,775
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

971
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:00,291
Deploy flaps!

972
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:02,710
Holy!

973
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:04,378
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

974
01:22:04,463 --> 01:22:06,005
The sat visual has been lost.

975
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,757
No way that's a UAV.

976
01:22:07,841 --> 01:22:09,008
What is it?

977
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:10,635
I can't see anything.

978
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,179
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

979
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,307
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

980
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:27,360
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

981
01:22:27,444 --> 01:22:29,111
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

982
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:30,488
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

983
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:32,073
No, see, this isn't a game.

984
01:22:32,157 --> 01:22:35,451
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

985
01:22:35,535 --> 01:22:37,453
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

986
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:40,373
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

987
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,875
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

988
01:22:44,044 --> 01:22:47,421
- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.

989
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:50,800
On your belly!

990
01:22:50,884 --> 01:22:52,760
It looks like a man!

991
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:55,638
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

992
01:23:03,689 --> 01:23:04,814
I'm hit! I'm hit!

993
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:07,233
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

994
01:23:11,363 --> 01:23:13,364
Punch out! Punch out!

995
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:21,497
Whiplash One down.

996
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:23,165
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

997
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,501
Negative! No chute, no chute!

998
01:23:31,008 --> 01:23:32,425
My chute's jammed!

999
01:23:38,432 --> 01:23:40,766
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

1000
01:23:40,851 --> 01:23:43,477
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1001
01:23:46,023 --> 01:23:47,857
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1002
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:50,026
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

1003
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,444
inside a legal no fly zone!

1004
01:23:51,528 --> 01:23:53,863
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1005
01:23:53,947 --> 01:23:56,323
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

1006
01:23:56,408 --> 01:23:57,783
Keep going!

1007
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,418
Good chute! Good chute!

1008
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:17,887
- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

1009
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:20,556
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1010
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:22,808
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1011
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:27,021
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1012
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:28,689
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1013
01:24:28,774 --> 01:24:31,650
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1014
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:33,360
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1015
01:24:33,445 --> 01:24:35,946
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1016
01:24:36,031 --> 01:24:37,782
It's not that simple.

1017
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:40,409
An unfortunate training exercise

1018
01:24:40,494 --> 01:24:43,370
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1019
01:24:44,122 --> 01:24:47,500
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1020
01:24:47,584 --> 01:24:51,504
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

1021
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:55,091
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

1022
01:24:55,175 --> 01:24:59,345
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

1023
01:25:01,348 --> 01:25:02,473
Hey!

1024
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:06,227
It is a tight fit, sir.

1025
01:25:07,229 --> 01:25:10,106
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

1026
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,149
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1027
01:25:13,026 --> 01:25:15,861
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

1028
01:25:17,114 --> 01:25:20,866
- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

1029
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,703
What's going on here?

1030
01:25:29,251 --> 01:25:33,337
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1031
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,756
Are those bullet holes?

1032
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:04,451
Welcome.

1033
01:26:07,831 --> 01:26:09,915
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1034
01:26:10,876 --> 01:26:14,503
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1035
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:16,672
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1036
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:18,549
Show me the weapon.

1037
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:23,262
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1038
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:42,573
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1039
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:47,203
So this is how he did it.

1040
01:26:47,537 --> 01:26:50,039
This is only a first, crude effort.

1041
01:26:50,248 --> 01:26:52,541
Stark has perfected his design.

1042
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:55,461
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1043
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:59,298
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1044
01:27:00,926 --> 01:27:03,260
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1045
01:27:05,055 --> 01:27:07,306
We have a common enemy.

1046
01:27:11,603 --> 01:27:13,562
If we are still in business,

1047
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:18,317
I will give you these designs

1048
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:20,819
as a gift.

1049
01:27:22,489 --> 01:27:23,864
And in turn,

1050
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:30,663
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1051
01:27:41,633 --> 01:27:44,593
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1052
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:48,973
Technology.

1053
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:54,353
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1054
01:27:55,563 --> 01:27:58,732
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.

1055
01:27:59,943 --> 01:28:02,361
That's the least of your problems.

1056
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:10,244
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1057
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:13,914
All right, let's finish up here.

1058
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:20,796
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1059
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,425
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1060
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,385
I want a prototype right away.

1061
01:28:34,561 --> 01:28:37,730
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1062
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:40,065
I need you to go to my office.

1063
01:28:40,567 --> 01:28:42,985
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1064
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:45,654
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1065
01:28:45,739 --> 01:28:47,323
This'll get you in.

1066
01:28:47,407 --> 01:28:48,991
It's probably under Executive Files.

1067
01:28:49,075 --> 01:28:51,493
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1068
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:54,246
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1069
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:56,999
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1070
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,167
Same drill.

1071
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:00,252
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1072
01:29:00,337 --> 01:29:03,422
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1073
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:05,424
Tony,

1074
01:29:07,761 --> 01:29:09,636
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1075
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:13,682
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1076
01:29:13,767 --> 01:29:17,394
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1077
01:29:17,645 --> 01:29:20,856
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1078
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:25,069
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1079
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,613
Is that so?

1080
01:29:29,783 --> 01:29:31,283
Well, then, I quit.

1081
01:29:34,371 --> 01:29:35,996
You stood by my side all these years

1082
01:29:36,081 --> 01:29:38,916
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1083
01:29:39,209 --> 01:29:41,043
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1084
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:42,961
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1085
01:29:43,046 --> 01:29:47,508
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1086
01:29:47,592 --> 01:29:49,593
I shouldn't be alive,

1087
01:29:50,887 --> 01:29:53,013
unless it was for a reason.

1088
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:55,724
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1089
01:29:56,226 --> 01:29:59,395
I just finally know what I have to do.

1090
01:30:03,733 --> 01:30:06,527
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1091
01:30:22,252 --> 01:30:24,670
You're all I have, too, you know.

1092
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:39,077
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1093
01:31:51,966 --> 01:31:56,303
You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

1094
01:31:56,387 --> 01:31:57,930
- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

1095
01:31:58,014 --> 01:32:00,724
...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1096
01:32:00,808 --> 01:32:03,519
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1097
01:32:07,524 --> 01:32:11,944
So, what are we going to do about this?

1098
01:32:23,915 --> 01:32:27,209
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1099
01:32:34,926 --> 01:32:38,637
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1100
01:33:00,243 --> 01:33:04,621
I was so happy when he came home.

1101
01:33:04,706 --> 01:33:07,499
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1102
01:33:10,545 --> 01:33:12,504
Now I realize,

1103
01:33:14,841 --> 01:33:18,093
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1104
01:33:19,846 --> 01:33:22,514
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1105
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:26,893
Breaks my heart.

1106
01:33:29,188 --> 01:33:33,191
Well, he's a complicated person.

1107
01:33:35,862 --> 01:33:39,281
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1108
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,373
You are a very rare woman.

1109
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:53,045
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1110
01:33:55,757 --> 01:33:57,758
Thank you. Thanks.

1111
01:33:59,761 --> 01:34:01,803
I'd better get back there.

1112
01:34:07,268 --> 01:34:09,311
Is that today's paper?

1113
01:34:10,938 --> 01:34:12,022
Yes.

1114
01:34:12,774 --> 01:34:14,191
Do you mind?

1115
01:34:14,776 --> 01:34:16,610
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1116
01:34:16,694 --> 01:34:18,028
Of course.

1117
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:22,824
Take care.

1118
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:49,851
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1119
01:34:49,936 --> 01:34:51,478
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1120
01:34:51,562 --> 01:34:52,688
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1121
01:34:52,772 --> 01:34:54,564
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1122
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,859
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1123
01:34:59,445 --> 01:35:02,280
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1124
01:35:02,657 --> 01:35:06,201
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1125
01:35:06,411 --> 01:35:09,079
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

1126
01:35:09,163 --> 01:35:11,415
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1127
01:35:11,499 --> 01:35:13,208
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1128
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:17,129
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1129
01:35:17,296 --> 01:35:20,465
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1130
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:26,555
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1131
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:30,600
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1132
01:35:30,685 --> 01:35:37,315
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1133
01:35:39,485 --> 01:35:42,571
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1134
01:35:58,671 --> 01:35:59,671
Tony?

1135
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:05,719
Tony, are you there? Hello?

1136
01:36:07,305 --> 01:36:08,513
Breathe.

1137
01:36:09,682 --> 01:36:12,434
Easy, easy.

1138
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,813
You remember this one, right?

1139
01:36:18,524 --> 01:36:20,817
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1140
01:36:20,902 --> 01:36:25,030
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1141
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:28,658
Tony.

1142
01:36:30,953 --> 01:36:35,332
When I ordered the hit on you,

1143
01:36:37,919 --> 01:36:40,420
I worried that I was

1144
01:36:43,466 --> 01:36:45,509
killing the golden goose.

1145
01:36:46,844 --> 01:36:50,597
But, you see, it was just

1146
01:36:51,933 --> 01:36:54,226
fate that you survived that.

1147
01:36:59,273 --> 01:37:03,151
You had one last golden egg to give.

1148
01:37:07,323 --> 01:37:12,619
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1149
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:21,670
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1150
01:37:21,754 --> 01:37:26,007
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1151
01:37:35,977 --> 01:37:37,644
Oh, it's beautiful.

1152
01:37:40,273 --> 01:37:45,110
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1153
01:37:47,405 --> 01:37:49,865
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1154
01:37:51,242 --> 01:37:52,993
This is your legacy.

1155
01:37:55,538 --> 01:38:00,750
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1156
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:07,674
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1157
01:38:07,758 --> 01:38:10,010
put the balance of power in our hands.

1158
01:38:11,596 --> 01:38:13,221
The right hands.

1159
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:20,896
I wish you could see my prototype.

1160
01:38:22,315 --> 01:38:23,815
It's not as...

1161
01:38:25,151 --> 01:38:28,153
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1162
01:38:30,156 --> 01:38:32,991
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1163
01:38:33,451 --> 01:38:36,036
I would have preferred that she lived.

1164
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:51,343
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1165
01:38:51,427 --> 01:38:54,054
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1166
01:38:55,306 --> 01:38:56,598
Okay, where's Tony now?

1167
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:58,391
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1168
01:38:58,476 --> 01:39:00,602
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1169
01:39:00,686 --> 01:39:03,313
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1170
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:10,922
Good boy.

1171
01:40:50,755 --> 01:41:01,723
Tony?

1172
01:41:04,393 --> 01:41:05,477
Tony!

1173
01:41:07,688 --> 01:41:09,981
Tony! You okay?

1174
01:41:10,316 --> 01:41:13,943
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1175
01:41:14,028 --> 01:41:16,362
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1176
01:41:16,489 --> 01:41:18,615
That's not going to be enough.

1177
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:48,436
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1178
01:41:57,446 --> 01:42:00,115
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1179
01:42:00,199 --> 01:42:02,367
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1180
01:42:02,451 --> 01:42:03,868
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1181
01:42:03,953 --> 01:42:06,704
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1182
01:42:25,266 --> 01:42:27,809
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1183
01:42:27,893 --> 01:42:30,687
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1184
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:39,737
You need me to do anything else?

1185
01:42:40,322 --> 01:42:42,115
Keep the skies clear.

1186
01:42:47,246 --> 01:42:48,538
Damn!

1187
01:42:56,589 --> 01:42:58,256
Next time, baby.

1188
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:31,748
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1189
01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:34,334
I thought it'd be bigger.

1190
01:44:19,171 --> 01:44:20,338
Take him out!

1191
01:44:31,058 --> 01:44:33,059
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1192
01:44:33,143 --> 01:44:35,436
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1193
01:44:35,521 --> 01:44:38,231
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

1194
01:44:38,315 --> 01:44:39,857
Keep me posted.

1195
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:42,610
Pepper!

1196
01:44:42,695 --> 01:44:45,697
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

1197
01:44:45,781 --> 01:44:47,699
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

1198
01:44:47,783 --> 01:44:49,575
- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

1199
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:51,119
Get out of there right now!

1200
01:45:02,965 --> 01:45:05,300
Where do you think you're going?

1201
01:45:10,806 --> 01:45:13,808
Your services are no longer required.

1202
01:45:14,018 --> 01:45:15,476
Stane!

1203
01:45:40,669 --> 01:45:42,337
I love this suit!

1204
01:45:42,421 --> 01:45:45,673
- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

1205
01:45:47,217 --> 01:45:49,260
Divert power to chest RT.

1206
01:45:57,978 --> 01:46:00,104
Power reduced to 19%.

1207
01:46:07,946 --> 01:46:09,072
Lady!

1208
01:46:10,949 --> 01:46:12,992
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1209
01:46:35,057 --> 01:46:38,017
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1210
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:44,941
I built this company from nothing!

1211
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:49,779
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1212
01:46:56,036 --> 01:46:58,579
Least of all you!

1213
01:47:08,006 --> 01:47:11,259
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

1214
01:47:11,844 --> 01:47:14,554
I've made some upgrades of my own!

1215
01:47:22,896 --> 01:47:24,856
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1216
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:26,607
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1217
01:47:26,692 --> 01:47:28,985
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1218
01:47:29,069 --> 01:47:31,237
I know the math! Do it!

1219
01:47:39,538 --> 01:47:41,831
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1220
01:47:41,915 --> 01:47:44,542
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1221
01:47:47,254 --> 01:47:50,256
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1222
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,591
Yes, sir.

1223
01:47:59,558 --> 01:48:01,476
- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

1224
01:48:05,481 --> 01:48:07,523
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

1225
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,365
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

1226
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:18,075
Stop telling me!

1227
01:48:27,753 --> 01:48:32,340
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

1228
01:48:32,925 --> 01:48:34,967
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1229
01:48:35,052 --> 01:48:36,552
Icing problem?

1230
01:48:38,764 --> 01:48:41,098
Might want to look into it.

1231
01:48:52,778 --> 01:48:54,111
Two percent.

1232
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:59,116
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1233
01:49:10,754 --> 01:49:14,215
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1234
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:18,427
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1235
01:49:18,512 --> 01:49:19,929
Nice try!

1236
01:49:32,484 --> 01:49:36,612
- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1237
01:49:40,867 --> 01:49:42,451
Flares!

1238
01:49:50,961 --> 01:49:53,004
Very clever, Tony.

1239
01:49:58,343 --> 01:50:00,803
- Potts?
- Tony!

1240
01:50:00,887 --> 01:50:01,887
This isn't working.

1241
01:50:01,972 --> 01:50:04,265
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1242
01:50:04,349 --> 01:50:07,226
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1243
01:50:07,311 --> 01:50:09,770
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1244
01:50:09,855 --> 01:50:11,272
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1245
01:50:11,356 --> 01:50:13,941
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1246
01:50:14,026 --> 01:50:15,401
It's going to fry everything up here.

1247
01:50:17,571 --> 01:50:19,864
Okay. I'm going in now.

1248
01:50:19,948 --> 01:50:23,200
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1249
01:50:32,711 --> 01:50:34,545
This looks important!

1250
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,194
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1251
01:50:58,278 --> 01:51:02,406
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1252
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:13,167
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1253
01:51:15,545 --> 01:51:17,672
You'd have made your father proud!

1254
01:51:22,636 --> 01:51:25,137
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1255
01:51:44,658 --> 01:51:45,991
Tony!

1256
01:51:47,202 --> 01:51:48,828
How ironic, Tony!

1257
01:51:50,622 --> 01:51:55,543
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1258
01:51:55,794 --> 01:52:01,674
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1259
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,556
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1260
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:12,643
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1261
01:52:14,688 --> 01:52:17,273
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1262
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,861
Push it!

1263
01:53:19,419 --> 01:53:21,212
Tony!

1264
01:53:29,638 --> 01:53:31,764
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1265
01:53:31,848 --> 01:53:34,141
at Stark Industries last night.

1266
01:53:34,476 --> 01:53:39,021
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1267
01:53:39,105 --> 01:53:41,732
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1268
01:53:42,442 --> 01:53:44,693
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1269
01:53:44,778 --> 01:53:46,695
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1270
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:50,449
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1271
01:53:50,534 --> 01:53:53,160
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1272
01:53:53,245 --> 01:53:54,912
Here's your alibi.

1273
01:53:55,747 --> 01:53:56,831
Okay.

1274
01:53:56,915 --> 01:53:59,083
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1275
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:01,293
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1276
01:54:01,378 --> 01:54:03,087
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1277
01:54:03,171 --> 01:54:06,298
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1278
01:54:06,383 --> 01:54:08,175
alone on the island.

1279
01:54:09,469 --> 01:54:10,761
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1280
01:54:10,846 --> 01:54:12,972
Just read it, word for word.

1281
01:54:14,891 --> 01:54:16,892
There's nothing about Stane here.

1282
01:54:16,977 --> 01:54:19,770
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1283
01:54:20,647 --> 01:54:23,107
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1284
01:54:23,191 --> 01:54:25,693
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1285
01:54:25,777 --> 01:54:28,696
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1286
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:31,073
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1287
01:54:31,157 --> 01:54:35,160
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1288
01:54:35,245 --> 01:54:37,496
You've got 90 seconds.

1289
01:54:40,375 --> 01:54:42,042
Agent Coulson?

1290
01:54:42,711 --> 01:54:47,214
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1291
01:54:47,299 --> 01:54:50,217
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1292
01:54:50,468 --> 01:54:53,846
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1293
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,347
Right.

1294
01:54:56,308 --> 01:55:00,227
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1295
01:55:00,312 --> 01:55:02,605
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1296
01:55:02,689 --> 01:55:04,231
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1297
01:55:04,316 --> 01:55:06,775
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1298
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:10,863
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1299
01:55:10,947 --> 01:55:13,490
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1300
01:55:13,575 --> 01:55:15,951
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1301
01:55:16,036 --> 01:55:19,788
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1302
01:55:21,499 --> 01:55:22,541
crazy about me.

1303
01:55:22,626 --> 01:55:24,293
Tell me you never think about that night.

1304
01:55:24,377 --> 01:55:26,253
- What night?
- You know.

1305
01:55:29,174 --> 01:55:34,970
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1306
01:55:36,598 --> 01:55:42,186
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1307
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:45,522
and you left me there, by myself?

1308
01:55:46,733 --> 01:55:49,276
Is that the night you're talking about?

1309
01:55:51,446 --> 01:55:52,529
Thought so.

1310
01:55:55,241 --> 01:55:58,994
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1311
01:55:59,079 --> 01:56:02,623
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1312
01:56:02,707 --> 01:56:05,751
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

1313
01:56:09,923 --> 01:56:15,052
Been a while since I was in front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1314
01:56:17,013 --> 01:56:20,057
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1315
01:56:20,141 --> 01:56:21,433
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1316
01:56:21,518 --> 01:56:24,311
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1317
01:56:24,396 --> 01:56:28,148
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1318
01:56:28,233 --> 01:56:31,318
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

1319
01:56:31,403 --> 01:56:35,030
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

1320
01:56:35,115 --> 01:56:38,367
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1321
01:56:38,451 --> 01:56:40,077
I never said you were a superhero.

1322
01:56:40,161 --> 01:56:45,499
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

1323
01:56:47,502 --> 01:56:50,754
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1324
01:56:51,297 --> 01:56:54,258
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1325
01:56:54,342 --> 01:56:55,801
all the mistakes I've made,

1326
01:56:55,885 --> 01:56:59,221
- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1327
01:56:59,305 --> 01:57:00,973
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1328
01:57:03,101 --> 01:57:04,601
The truth is

1329
01:57:10,775 --> 01:57:12,276
I am Iron Man.

1330
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:16,760
Jarvis!

1331
02:05:16,844 --> 02:05:18,595
Welcome home, sir.

1332
02:05:22,016 --> 02:05:27,521
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1333
02:05:27,855 --> 02:05:31,107
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1334
02:05:31,192 --> 02:05:32,984
You just don't know it yet.

1335
02:05:33,486 --> 02:05:35,278
Who the hell are you?

1336
02:05:35,488 --> 02:05:38,198
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1337
02:05:40,284 --> 02:05:43,286
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
